{% include base_path %}

Since 2018, I lead the Edge AI group at I2R A*STAR Singapore, with the focus on development of compact neural networks and the applications for the next-generation deep learning hardware, efficient deep learning on encrypted data for privacy preserving, TinyML for IoT, etc.

From 2011 â€“ 2014, I served as core contributor to the MPEG-7 International standardization on [Compact Descriptors for Visual Search (CDVS)](http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-7/compact-descriptors-visual-search)
Contributions on scalable and compact global descriptor are adopted by MPEG CDVS as one of the three core technologies, 
competitors include Stanford IVMS lab, 
Huawei, University of Surrey, Samsung, ST Electronics, etc.
Over 20 proposals have been submitted, with 8 patents granted, one of the grants received the 19th China Excellent Patent Award (National Award).
The invented technology has been adopted by Tencent [WeChat open platform](http://open.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=overseas\_open/docs/mobile/smart\#mobile\_smart), [Baidu mobile app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/beijing-baidu-netcom-science-technology-co-ltd/id372585298), etc. 
It also initiated a startup [Boyun Vision](http://www.boyunvision.com.cn) in Beijing, China.
